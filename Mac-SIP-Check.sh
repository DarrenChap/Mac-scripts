# System Integrity Protection (SIP) is integral to the security of macOS. The system
# prevents unauthorized tampering with protected files in various locations on the boot
# volume. Disabling SIP is not recommended, and requires physical access to the machine
# and specific intent to remove the security it provides. It's not something that can be
# done accidentally. 
#
# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection
# 
# This script will alert if SIP has been disabled on the Mac, and immediately enable it,
# which requires rebooting. Use with caution, as a sudden reboot can result in the user
# losing any unsaved work.

# Thanks to Mike Lambert from the MacAdmins Slack for the inspiration and collaboration.
